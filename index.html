      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Taare Zameen Par is a 2007 Indian Hindi-language drama film produced and directed by Aamir Khan which gives a new definition to disability. The film is centred around the life and imagination of Ishaan, an 8-year-old dyslexic child with special needs. The story revolves around the struggle of this dyslexic child who finds it hard to adjust and compete in the normal world where competition is the only standard and the constructed and enforced uniformity is dominant. This film is remarkable as it not only entertained the audience but also represented dyslexia- a kind of disability with great nuance that made the audience more aware about the sensitivity with which a disability needs to be addressed. This film not only addresses the issue but also very beautifully brings out a solution, a rather inclusive idea which is more important today to be considered. The basic idea that the film portrays is that every child is unique and special. If a child lags or doesn’t go with the flow created by the society, it doesn’t mean that he or she is incapable. Often people who go out of the normalcy or the track are marginalized. This film is a great example of how it should not work that way. This essay is an attempt to analyse the film in relation to disability under its social and medical model.

      <h2>What is Disability?</h2>
      <p>A disability can generally be defined as a situation which may limit a person from completing a work in a similar way as any non-disabled person. Disability affects individuals in many different ways. Generally, the 'disabled' is linked with physical or mental impairments. The common perception is that people with disabilities are completely different, and therefore, need to be treated differently. unfortunately, this kind of labelling in itself discriminates them and leads to their marginalization in the society.
